# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to the latest released version.

If you are using an older version, please upgrade to the latest release before reporting an issue (or include details so we can confirm whether the issue still reproduces).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Instead, use one of the following private reporting methods:

1. **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting (preferred)**  
   Use: https://github.com/sancho1952007/secret-sharer/security/advisories/new

2. **Email**  
   Send an email to: **sancho@sg-app.com**  

When reporting, please include:
- A clear description of the vulnerability and impact
- Steps to reproduce (proof of concept if possible)
- Any relevant logs, screenshots, or stack traces
- Your suggested fix or mitigation (if you have one)
